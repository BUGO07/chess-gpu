# Chess

Chess written with unreadable, incomplete and buggy spaghetti-code that utilizes the GPU for fast rendering and cool shader effects.

## Future Hopes

Make use of compute shaders for the game logic.

## Building and Running

Make sure you have rust installed on your machine.

Then just `cargo run`
